Rank order the occupations suitable for a person.

1. Rank order all the possible occupations using the the matches of the person's resume to occupation descriptions.
2. For the best N matching occupations, rank order other occupations using the tasks that each occupation is expected to be able to perform.

In this implementation:

- The resumes are in a text file
- The occupations are in a csv file containing 
    - Description of the occupation
    - Tasks someone in the occupation is expected to be able to perform.
